Catching up on some reading today and came across this:

> [Claude Code] has the potential to transform all of tech. **I also think we’re going to see a real split in the tech industry (and everywhere code is written) between people who are outcome-driven and are excited to get to the part where they can test their work with users faster, and people who are process-driven and get their meaning from the engineering itself and are upset about having that taken away**. (This is not to say that there aren’t many issues with AI aside from these things, of course.)

> It wouldn’t surprise me to see more artisanal teams, startups, and small businesses spring up to give that second set a home. But I think we’ll also see more startups and projects created by the first set, too.

That's [Ben Werdmuller](https://werd.io/2025-the-year-in-llms/) (emphasis mine), responding to [Simon Willison's recap of the year in LLMs](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/31/the-year-in-llms/#atom-everything) ([Simon also published some predictions for 2026](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/))
