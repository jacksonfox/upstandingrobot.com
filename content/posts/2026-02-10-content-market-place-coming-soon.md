Missed this news last week, but [Microsoft is working on a content marketplace](https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en/blog/post/february-2026/building-toward-a-sustainable-content-economy-for-the-agentic-web) to help content creators license access to their content to AI providers. Now comes word from an AWS conference that [Amazon is doing the same thing](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-discusses-ai-content-marketplace-with-publishers-information-reports-2026-02-10/). This follows on the release of the "official" [Really Simple Licensing spec](https://rslstandard.org/) which provides a way for content providers to communicate access and licensing terms for their content to bots. However, no bots I'm aware of have indicated they'll support RSL. Google has made some noise about monetization tools, but I'm not aware of them pursuing something along these lines.
