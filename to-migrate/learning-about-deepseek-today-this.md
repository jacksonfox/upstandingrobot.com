Learning about DeepSeek today ...

* This great [FAQ](https://stratechery.com/2025/deepseek-faq/) from Ben Thompson digs into why this is big deal, why it might be good in the long run, and also provides a nice background on different reinforcement learning approaches.
* You'd be right to think DeepSeek, an AI model from a Chinese company, [doesn't want to talk about some things](https://sherwood.news/tech/a-free-powerful-chinese-ai-model-just-dropped-but-dont-ask-it-about/).
* [DeepSeek was surprisingly cheap to train and is very cheap to use](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/26/deepseek-v3/) (compared to similar models from OpenAI and Anthropic).
