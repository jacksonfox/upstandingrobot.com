> After plenty of discussions and tons of exploration, I think we can simplify the world of AI use cases into three simple, distinct buckets:
> 
> 1. Gods: Super-intelligent, artificial entities that do things autonomously.
> 2. Interns: Supervised copilots that collaborate with experts, focusing on grunt work.
> 3. Cogs: Functions optimized to perform a single task extremely well, usually as part of a pipeline or interface.
